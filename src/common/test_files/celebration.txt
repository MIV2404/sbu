Unwritten Law - Celebration Song

Ease up a little bit
'Cause I want to want you
Follow the money spent
Well, that's fine to guide you
By my side, let's go for a long ride
In my car, I'll drive you to my star
Out in space, won't matter where we are
Hey, hey, yeah
A celebration, about time
A generation out of line, yeah
A revolution's in everyone (ah)
Blame the gun
Blame the gun
Ease up a little bit
'Cause I have to have you
Drink up a little bit
If you're mine, I'll find you
By my side, let's go for a long ride
In my car, I'll drive you to my star
Out in space, won't matter where we are
Hey, hey, yeah
A celebration, about time
A generation out of line, yeah
A revolution's in everyone (ah)
Blame the gun, yeah
Yeah
Hey, hey, yeah
A celebration, about time
A generation out of line, yeah
A revolution's in everyone
Blame the...
Celebration, about time
Generation's out of line, yeah
Revolution's in everyone (ah)
Blame the gun
Blame the gun
Blame the gun now
Ooh, blame the gun
